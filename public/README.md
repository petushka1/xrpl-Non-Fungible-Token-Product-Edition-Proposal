*Example:*

```
{
  'id': '0',
  'name': 'Tonic',
  'spec': ['CANOPY', 'Back End Dev', '2015'],
  'brief': 'A daily selection of privately personalized reads; no accounts or sign-ups required.',
  'description': 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essent',
  'image': 'Img'+'\\'+'SnapshootPortfolio3.png',
  'alt': 'project 1',
  'technologies': ['html', 'css', 'javaScript'],
  'liveLink': 'https://username.github.io/',
  'sourceLink': 'https://github.com/username'
},
```
